# ByteTrack Configuration for YOLOv8
# Ultralytics built-in tracker config

# Tracker type (BoT-SORT or ByteTrack)
tracker_type: bytetrack

# ByteTrack Parameters
bytetrack:
  # Detection confidence thresholds
  track_high_thresh: 0.5    # High confidence threshold for track initialization
  track_low_thresh: 0.1     # Low confidence threshold for track association
  new_track_thresh: 0.6     # Threshold for new track creation
  
  # Track lifecycle
  track_buffer: 30          # Frames to keep lost tracks (30 frames = ~1 sec at 30 FPS)
  match_thresh: 0.8         # IoU threshold for matching detections to tracks
  
  # Misc
  frame_rate: 30            # Expected FPS (adjust based on your camera)

# NOTES:
# - track_high_thresh: Detections above this start new tracks
# - track_low_thresh: Lower detections can extend existing tracks (reduces ID switches)
# - track_buffer: Higher = more robust to occlusions, but uses more memory
# - match_thresh: Higher = stricter matching (fewer ID switches but more new IDs)
