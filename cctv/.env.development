# Local development environment
# Used when running 'npm start' locally

# API routes will be proxied to localhost:8000
# No need to set REACT_APP_API_URL for local development
# The package.json proxy handles it automatically

# For production deployment, this file is NOT used
# Production uses relative /api/ paths
